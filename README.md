# A modified [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

This is a modified [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), the functions I added are listed as follows,

1. Let users apply any iframe object as header for 'single' layout, e.g., 
```yaml
title: "Global mobility change"
header:
  iframe:
    url: https://dash-covid-mobi.herokuapp.com/
```
